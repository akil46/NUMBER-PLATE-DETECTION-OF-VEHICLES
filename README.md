# NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION-OF-VEHICLES
Number plate detection (also known as Automatic Number Plate Recognition or ANPR) is used to identify and read vehicle license plates from images or video streams. Here's a breakdown of its purpose, usage, technologies, and libraries:
1. Purpose

Traffic law enforcement (e.g., speed limit, red-light violations)
Toll collection
Parking management
Border control and surveillance
Vehicle access control in secure areas
Stolen vehicle identification

2. Usage Flow

1. Image acquisition (from CCTV, traffic cameras, etc.)
2. Preprocessing (noise reduction, grayscale conversion)
3. License plate detection
4. Character segmentation
5. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for reading plate characters
6. Database lookup (optional, for validation or matching)

3. Technologies Involved

Computer Vision
Image Processing
Machine Learning / Deep Learning
OCR
Edge AI (for real-time processing on cameras or edge devices)4. Popular Libraries & Tools
Python-Based
OpenCV – Image processing and plate localization
EasyOCR / Tesseract OCR – Reading text from images
YOLO (You Only Look Once) – Forplate detection (deep learning object detection)
Keras / TensorFlow / PyTorch – For custom detection and recognition modelsALPR Libraries:OpenALPR – Open-source ANPR system (C++ with Python bindings)
Plate Recognizer SDK – Commercial API for ANPR
